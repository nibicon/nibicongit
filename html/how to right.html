<div  style="color: blue; font-size: 30px;"> <i> Great ad headlines are like the flashy displays you see in store windows every day. They’re there to stop you in your tracks, make you picture yourself owning whatever it is they’re selling, and force you to cross the psychological threshold and walk into the store to buy it.</i></div> <br> <br>

	1. Include Keywords
This one might seem like a no-brainer, but I’m consistently amazed by how many ads I see with vague, ambiguous headlines that don’t feature the keyword I searched for – like the one below. The keyword I searched for was “sportcoats.”

PPC ad headlines misleading ad
Yes, Lands’ End make sportcoats, but this ad doesn’t offer what I want, so why would I waste time clicking on it?

Don’t make your prospects guess what you sell. Make the connection between their search query and your ad crystal clear by including the keyword in the headline.

2. Ask Questions
Leveraging user intent is crucial to increasing conversion rates. One way to do this is by asking the searcher a question with your headline.

PPC ad headlines divorce ad
The example ad above is quite clever. Not only does it pose a question in the ad headline, it also uses very particular phrasing (“Protecting your family”) that implies solidarity and dependability – qualities that you could very well be looking for in a divorce attorney.

This is also an exception to the “include the keyword” tip outlined above – although this ad headline doesn’t include the keyword I searched for, it’s still a much more compelling ad than the others I saw. If I were looking for a divorce attorney – which I’m not, by the way! – this ad would get the click.

3. Solve Prospects’ Problems
Perry Marshall, author of the world’s best-selling book on Google AdWords, is always talking about the importance of solving prospects’ problems in your ad copy. This technique is just as crucial when it comes to your ad headlines as it is in the body copy of your ad.

People don’t want to buy “things” – they want to solve their problems. <br><br>
